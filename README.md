# Draft Basic Full Stack App

In this assignment I created a **Next.js** app using *npx create-next-app*.
Witten in **Javascript**, it uses **dynamic page routing** to
display data from **JSON** files. It imagines a boat race taking place in a techno-futuristic wild west, perhaps a gaming universe.
